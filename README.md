## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### Objectives

+ Build an application will implement full web-based C.R.U.D. functionality, using Spring MVC and the DAO pattern. 
 To display a list of films and actors associated with the film from a database. The DAO implementation will use JDBC to persist and retrieve data.

### Topics/Technologies Used

+ Java 
+ Spring MVC
+ MySql
+ Gradle
+ Bootstrap
+ HTML / CSS
+ XML

### Concepts/ Topics Covered
 
 + First time using Spring Tool Suite and using Spring MVC and Gradle to build this project. Using forms to do GET and POST request, 
  mapping those request to a controller that will then select the correct DAO implementation to grab the correct information for the database. 


### Lesson Learned
 + We paired programmed this entire project to reinforce our understanding of using Spring MVC and using DAO patterns to create a dynamic web pages.
 This was the team's first time using the technology and we are very proud of completing this project. Each one of us make leaps in bounds in our
 understanding of the concepts and technologies used and that is what we are most proud of. It was a learning experience and since we paired programmed
 this project, this will help us be better collaborators for future projects like our midterm in two weeks.
 + We communicated very well throughout the completion of this project because no one was confused as we connected the Controller and DAO to the database and web pages.
 If anyone had questions, we tried to explained as we went along and not taking learning experience from any member. We also drew how the project was connect on
 a white board to help us visual how the project was created. 
 + We are still learning and getting comfortable with vocabulary and what everything means when speaking and had to connect everything through trial and error,
  mostly because this was our first project doing this.
 + We also had to focus on getting a functionality working before spending a lot of time debugging and checking for possible bugs. We tried to focus on bigger picture
 functionality and then try to get the smaller details working.
 + We would have liked to completed a JUNIT test for every code we written, but due to the lack of experience and time constraint. This would have resulted in an incomplete project.
 + We would have liked to added additional functionality like adding and actor to the database, update or deleting an actor, adding/removing an actor to a film.
